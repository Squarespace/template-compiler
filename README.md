## Overview

Squarespace's template language is based on JSON-Template, a minimal
declarative template language for Python and JavaScript, heavily influenced by
[google-ctemplate][goog-ct].


## Objectives

The project was started with these objectives:

 * Move away from using [Node.js][nodejs] for backend template compilation.
 * Must meet or exceed performance of the legacy system. The compiler can
   potentially execute several times for each page view, so it needs to be
   really fast.
 * Improve performance over the legacy system.
 * Minimize memory usage. For example, parsing can often create and discard a
   high number of temporary strings.
 * Support additional features for server-side compilation.
 * High test coverage.
 * Support syntax error recovery.
 * Support a template validation mode.


## Measured Results

 * Average 20x performance increase over previous Node.js + JSON-Template
   system.
